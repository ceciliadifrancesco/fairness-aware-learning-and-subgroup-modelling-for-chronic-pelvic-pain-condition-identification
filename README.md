Bachelor Thesis - Supervisor: Luca Saglietti

This repository contains my Bachelor’s thesis, **“Fairness-aware Learning and Subgroup Modelling for Chronic Pelvic Pain Condition Identification”**, completed as part of my BSc in Economics, Management and Computer Science.

The work focuses on developing and evaluating **machine learning pipelines for symptom-based diagnosis** of chronic pelvic pain conditions using self-reported health data, with a particular emphasis on **fairness, subgroup bias, and model robustness** in underrepresented patient populations.

## Problem Setting
Chronic pelvic pain conditions such as endometriosis, adenomyosis, PCOS, and vulvodynia are often underdiagnosed due to heterogeneous symptom profiles, low prevalence rates, and biased datasets. Standard classification models tend to optimize global performance while underperforming on minority subgroups.

## Methodology
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering on structured questionnaire data  
- Unsupervised clustering to identify latent patient subgroups  
- Supervised classification models (e.g. tree-based models and neural networks)  
- Cluster-informed and structure-aware modeling strategies  
- Evaluation using both global metrics and subgroup-level performance  
- Analysis of fairness-related disparities induced by data imbalance  

## Key Contributions
- Empirical analysis of subgroup bias in symptom-based healthcare ML models  
- Demonstration of trade-offs between global accuracy and subgroup robustness  
- Exploration of subgroup-aware approaches as a fairness-oriented modeling strategy  

## Context
The thesis is based on real-world data collected through a women’s health screening application and builds on applied research conducted during an industry internship in femtech. The goal is to highlight practical challenges in deploying ML systems for healthcare decision support under fairness and reliability constraints.
